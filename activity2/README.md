# COSC 110 ACTIVITY NO. 2
This notebook focuses on the crucial steps of data cleaning for the Titanic dataset, followed by initial exploratory data analysis to derive basic insights.

## Project Goal
 The primary goal of this activity is to demonstrate data cleaning procedures and perform fundamental data analysis, guided by the principles of computational thinking.
 
## Dataset
The analysis uses the classic Titanic dataset, sourced from: [Kaggle's Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data)

## Analysis Highlights & Computational Thinking
The complete code and detailed steps for this analysis are provided within the accompanying Jupyter Notebook. Below is a summary of the key questions addressed and the computational thinking applied:

### Question 1: Data Cleaning Methodology
This section details the approach to data cleaning. It addresses what constitutes "clean data" for this dataset, identifies the specific issues found (like missing values, irrelevant columns, and data type inconsistencies), and outlines the strategic algorithm chosen to resolve these problems. The chosen methods (e.g., median for Age, mode for Embarked, dropping Cabin and PassengerId, standardizing formats) are justified by their suitability for the dataset's characteristics and the goal of preparing the data for analysis.

### Question 2: Basic Data Analysis Insights
This section presents two fundamental data analyses performed on the cleaned dataset, along with their visualizations and key deductions:
- Survival Count and Gender Analysis: This explores the overall survival numbers and specifically investigates the disparity in survival rates between male and female passengers. The analysis highlights a significant pattern suggesting prioritization based on gender during the disaster.
- Passenger Class and Survival Analysis: This examines the relationship between a passenger's class (Pclass) and their likelihood of survival. The findings reveal a clear trend indicating that higher passenger classes correlated with significantly better survival rates, implying that socio-economic status played a crucial role.
