## Table of Contents

- [Computational Thinking with the Titanic Dataset](/lab1_titanic_villareal.ipynb) - Activity 1
  - In this activity, we attempt to apply the four pillars of computational thinking: Decomposition, Pattern Recognition, Abstraction, and Algorithm Design.
  - And, analyze the Titanic dataset to identify key insights and stories of the data.
  
- [Data Cleaning and Analysis using Titanic Dataset](/lab2_titanic_villareal.ipynb) - Activity 2
  - This time, we focus on Data Cleaning, preparation of the data for analysis.
  - And, we once again analyze the Titanic dataset to identify key insights and stories of the data.
  
- [Introduction to SymPy](/lab3_sympy_villareal.ipynb) - Activity 3
  - In this activity, we apply basic calculation using SymPy.
  - We explore, the simplest requirements needed for SymPy to work and its basic usage.
    
- [Exploring Calculus using SymPy](lab4_sympy_villareal.ipynb) - Activity 4
 - This time, we use SymPy for advanced mathematics, Calculus.
 - Using SymPy, we solve for: Limits, Derivatives, Algebraic Functions, and Series Expansion (Taylor & Maclaurin)
