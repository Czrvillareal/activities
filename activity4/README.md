# COSC110 ACTIVITY NO. 4
This notebook serves as an introductory guide to performing fundamental calculus operations using SymPy, demonstrating how Python can simplify complex mathematical concepts.

## Project Goal
The primary objective of this activity is to explore how Python, specifically using SymPy, can be used to understand basic ideas in calculus without requiring manual complex mathematical calculations.

## Insights
The accompanying Jupyter Notebook contains all the code snippets and detailed outputs for each step. Below, we summarize the key questions addressed and the insights gained:

### Question 1: What does 'x + x' mean?
It represents the symbolic addition of two variables, x, resulting in 2x, correctly reflecting the combination of two identical terms.

### Question 2: What does 'x * x' represent?
This signifies the symbolic multiplication of x by itself, leading to x**2 (x squared).

### Question 3: What result do you get for limit(sin(x)/x, x, 0) and what does it mean?
The result is 1. This means that as x approaches 0, the limit of the expression sin(x)/x is 1. This is a fundamental limit in calculus.

### Question 4: What is the output of diff(x**2, x) and what does it tell you?
The output is 2x. This is the derivative of x<sup>2</sup> with respect to x, illustrating SymPy's ability to perform symbolic differentiation.

### Question 5: What do you see from exp(x).series(x, 0, 4) and how many terms are shown?
The output shows the first few terms of the Taylor series expansion for e<sup>x<sup/> around x=0.

### Question 6: What are the answers from solve(Eq(x**2 - 4, 0), x)?
The answers are -2, 2.

### Question 7: What kind of problem do you think this is?
This is a problem of finding the roots (or solutions) of a quadratic equation.
